# SDSU-CS496-S21-G1
This is the README file for the class gradebook software system for CS496 Group 1 (Erik Torres, Brandon Reiley, Bhavya Desai).

The software system's purpose is to provide a way for instructors to manage class assignments.

 This class is designed to hold and allow access to the assignment objects.
 
Assignment: This class is used to create assignments that are essentially stored in a gradebook object.

What is Gradebook Software?
Gradebook software automates grade tracking, performance assessment and monitoring of student attendance and provides easy access to synchronized data for teachers, principals and school administrators.

In this gradebook we will provide services to the user such as adding assignment, edit assignment, list assignment and remove assignment.

The assignName attribute holds the name of an assignment and is of data type String. The assignID attribute holds the attached Identification number of an assignment and is of datatype int. The assignPercentage attribute is used to hold the percentage an assignment has for the total grade and is of datatype double. The assignDescription attribute is used to hold a description of an assignment; it uses a String datatype

The code gives you 5 options 
option 1: it allows the user to add the assignmnet
option 2: iT allows the user to edit the assignmnet which is already stored in the gradebook
option 3: it allows the user to view the assignment after submitting it 
oprion 4: it allows the user to remove the assignment 
option 5: it allows the user to exit the gradebook

The user will get an option to enter the name of the assignment. Then it allows the user to enter a description of the assignment.
After entering the description of the assignment the user will wull get an option to assign an ID. WHen all the steps are done the gradebook allows to assign a percentage to the assignment.

We will be saving the array list the in future. The software is not able to save the Gradebook once the software is closed. This functionality is planned for future releases.
